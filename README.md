# Steamish

Practice with Utility Classes, Special-Purpose Repository Methods and More Complex SQL

## Project Description
Streamish is a social app for sharing videos with others. For the time being we'll focus on using building a Web API. In future chapters we'll be creating a React application that will interact with the API. Along the way we'll dig into some more complex queries.
